# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview
After a trip to NYC, and noticing the prominence of bike sharing programs during our trip, fellow business partners and I have decided to analyze data from Citi Bike in order to determine whether a similar business model would work in Des Moines, IA.  The analysis performed took a look at the demographic of Citi Bike users, as well as how long they are using the bikes, and where they are using the bikes.  We have decided to use Tableau to vizualize the data for a potential local investement group.

## Results

### Trip Duration
Another piece of information we set out to determine, is how long are bikes being used?  This vizualization gives our investors a good understanding of useage in order to determine the amount of equipment they need to invest in, in order to have the proper amount of equipment.  It also shows them that the Men tend to use bikes more, and for longer periods of time, so that they can market appropriately.

### Useage hours
Bike useage is highest during the weekdays, either in the mornings between the hours of 07:00- 09:00AM and in the evenings between 04:00 and 07:00PM.  Knowing when people are using bikes is important, in order to properly schedule maitenance as well as to get a better understanding of what people are using the bikes for.  The data suggests that a significant portion of people are using bikes for work commute.

### Location Useage
Although New York City and Des Moines are vastly different cities, this graphic shows that bike useage is much higher in higher traffic areas.  Also that useage is higher in downtown locations where commuters work and where tourists are likely visiting.

## Summary
In summary, it seems that the majority of users are using Citi Bike for their workday commutes.  A siginificant amount of users are one off, but that is understandable given the amount of tourists in NYC.  The fact that the majority of users are subscribers is a positive sign for our venture in Des Moines, because there will not be nearly as many tourists.  Our business venture can focus on putting bikes in the heavier populated downtown areas or near large businesses, so that we can focus on providing a commuting alternative to driving to work.  Additional findings on the customer base can be found below.

### Customer Base
One of the most important pieces of information we set out to find, is who are Citi Bikes customers? Using a Tableau dashbord I have added two additional vizualizations that I would set out to perform analysis on before presenting to our investors.  Our vizualization shows that the majority of users are subscribers as opposed to one-off customers.  And that the majority of riders are male.
